# Exploring customer insights

## Your mission
You have two different sets of contact details provided to you. One from the contact center team and the other from the waste management department. In real life the major problem is that the two departments arn't talking from the same view.

This means that when a person calls and makes a complaint if it needs to be passed through to waste management, waste management are missing some of the golden information that the contact centre has.

With that brief intro this is the challenge:
* Merge the two datasets into a single customer view
* Remove any duplication due to the merge
* Add in LGAS to the dataset
* Enrich your merged dataset with demographic information

At the end you need to figure out a way that the two teams can now use this beautifully single customer view, maybe a power bi report?
